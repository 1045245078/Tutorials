# GPU-Computing-Intro
Sample codes for GPU Computing


# Remark
The codes only work for Linux and Mac OSX, since a little system programming is required. However, user may
try to compile under Windows by changing
```
#define USE_UNIX 1
```
to 
```
#define USE_UNIX 0
```

Windows environment isn't tested. Thanks.
